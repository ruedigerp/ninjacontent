#### Generate static web pages

Creating pages with Markdown, generate and copy to one or more servers. 
Your server does require PHP, Perl, ASP.net, Java. No MySQL, Postgres or MS SQL database is required.

#### Why Content Ninja

Many people want to create a website and have no idea of the technology for this. 
Why should they, they just want to have a website. 
Ask someone which knows a little about it. The result is:

  * Webspace is too expensive.
  * With PHP, Perl, Python etc.
  * With a database with which you are unfamiliar.
  * There are foisted oversized server.

Then install WordPress, Joomla, Typo3 or other content management systems. 
there are never seen a updated and will eventually targets of attacks or used for attacks against other systems.

Instead of buying a server for $ 30, you prefer to buy 3-6 small server, create the page with content Ninja and spread the load across all servers.

  * Update single server without downtimes.
  * Swap single server without downtimes.

Is Content Ninja used together with Subversion or GIT, you can switch back to old versions of texts.
Or create a so-called "Branch" and redesigned the layout. So you can test it without the homepage on the Internet to destroy. 
When you are ready you can easily do both merge and puts it online. Does not work out something, then it rolls back.



#### One File, One Page. 

A page in a file has a header and the content.
